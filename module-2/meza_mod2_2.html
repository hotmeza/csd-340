            <p class="intro">Hi! My name is Kevin and I live in Orlando, FL. I live and breathe Disney and I decided to work in the theme parks when it was time to do so. Is Disney a cult? Well... for some people it is. It's just a bunch of grown adults idolizing furry mascots. No harm, right? </p>
            <p>I love listening to K-Pop and my favorite band is <span class="sentence">Girl's Generation</span>. They are South Korea's National Girl Group and they are just angels. Each of them (8 members) has a different personality and there is a flavor for everyone. They have paved the way for girl groups to persevere in a mainly male dominated music industry. I also love what they stand for: wholesome girl power! </p>
            <p>I'm starting my dev journey at a later age in life but I hope to gather some great knowledge and skills and maybe things will get easier as time goes on but man oh man, these classes are kicking my butt and I spent 4 whole days trying to get a simple HTML issue and I got it to work by simply toggling off a box in the settings. I've never felt such relief and pride as to when I saw the final result, so I'm very happy to be continuing on and fighting the good fight.</p>
            <p>If I could have any kind of pet, I would love a cat! I want a kitty that acts like a dog! One that is cuddly, that loves belly scratches, that'll ultimately be my best friend. I would hope that once I could learn some more skills in this program, I could climb out of this financial rut I'm in and I can aspire to maybe even rent a studio apartment and have a cat! That would be the true dream!</p>
